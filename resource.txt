- 5x5 board. One team aiming "up" and the other aiming "down"

- directionality matters. Many pieces asymmetric behavior vertically.
	
	- some complexity in correctly managing the side.

=> (starting) TOP side and (starting) BOTTOM side

- ideally, validation logic is kept in the `board` model and not the individual pieces. cleaner and easier to run custom boards. however, this leads to a real issue with infinite path pieces that are constraied only by the spaces available to them.

- would a linked list handle the potential moveset of rooks / bishops well?

- promotions:

	- promotion is tricky. There are 2 ways someone could end up in a promotion zone:

	1. movement
	2. placement

	- promotion isn't available on PLACEMENT. so we need:

		- insta-promotion case, movement
		- a check to see if we want to promote a piece on the next turn...does it require movement?

	- promotion isn't self-evident because pawns -> SG / GG are not differentiable from the innate ones. And the promotion is reverted on capture. so it MUST be a property of the class.
