- 5x5 board. One team aiming "up" and the other aiming "down"

- directionality matters. Many pieces asymmetric behavior vertically.
	
	- some complexity in correctly managing the side.

=> (starting) TOP side and (starting) BOTTOM side

- ideally, validation logic is kept in the `board` model and not the individual pieces. cleaner and easier to run custom boards. however, this leads to a real issue with infinite path pieces that are constraied only by the spaces available to them.

- would a linked list handle the potential moveset of rooks / bishops well?
